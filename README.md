# Transport Automation System
It is a system to automate the transportation of heavy duty cargo and retail customer luggages.

This project is based on existing manual transportation and replace it with an application where the Cargo Booking & Cargo deliveries can be handled. Aim is to automate the existing manual system with an application, to ease the overall process and valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with quick accessing.
          
The application helps to manage working of a transport business. It stores records of vehicles, drivers, services, cargos, booking, consignors and consignees.
