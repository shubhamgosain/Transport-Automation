Transport Automation System to automate the transportation
This is my small project based on the criteria of Transport Automation System; it is a place where the Freight Booking & Freight deliveries are done. The aim is to automate its existing manual system by the help of computerised equipments and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same.
          
           	Basically the project describes how to manage working of transport. Project store and manipulate records of vehicles, drivers, services, freight, booking etc. modify consignors and consignee list etc.

          	For easy and convenient processing we need to develop software, which works as per our requirements. While preparing this software we got to remember few things i.e. this software must have a friendly environment, in other words it should not be much complicated to handle, it should have options for future modifications in the Transport.
